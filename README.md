# Symfony Simple REST API Books

This project is a simple REST API for managing books using Symfony, a PHP framework. It is designed as a personal project to learn and practice PHP and Symfony.

## Requirements

- PHP 8.1 or higher
- Composer
- Symfony CLI
- PostgreSQL

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
2. Install dependencies:
    ```sh
    composer install
    ```
3. Set up the environment variables:

4. Create the database and run migrations:
    ```sh
    php bin/console doctrine:database:create
    php bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate
    ```

5. Start the Symfony server:
    ```sh
    symfony server:start
    ```

## Usage

### Current Implementation

- The controller defines routes for CRUD operations (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`).

#### Endpoints:
- **GET /books**: Retrieve a list of all books.
- **GET /books/{id}**: Retrieve a specific book by its ID.
- **POST /books**: Create a new book.
- **PUT /books/{id}**: Update an existing book.
- **DELETE /books/{id}**: Delete a book.

### Suggestions for Improvement

1. **Validation**:
    - Add validation for the request data to ensure that required fields are present and correctly formatted.
    - Use Symfony's validation component to validate the `Book` entity.

2. **Service Layer**:
    - Consider moving business logic (e.g., creating, updating, deleting books) to a service class. This keeps the controller thin and focused on handling HTTP requests.

3. **DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)**:
    - Use DTOs to encapsulate request data. This helps in validating and transforming data before passing it to the service layer.

4. **Error Handling**:
    - Improve error handling by returning more informative error messages and status codes.
    - Use Symfony's exception handling mechanism to create custom exceptions and error responses.

5. **Logging**:
    - Add logging to track important events and errors. This helps in debugging and monitoring the application.

6. **Security**:
    - Ensure that the API endpoints are secured, especially for operations like creating, updating, and deleting books.
    - Use Symfony's security component to handle authentication and authorization.

Feel free to implement these suggestions or add your own features to enhance the API.
